# base-system_jsArrayFunc
It's a system for that is very weird using the object-arrays in javascript, the main file is the 'index.js' file, the html file is for testing 'index.html', so yeah u can dowmload it I think, LOL, and it works easily you can edit the code to make it easier to interact, but now it's just in the console...

yeah weird thing, but yeah this is a 'royalty-free' script asset for web-dev with objects & arrays in javascript
so, yeah nothing bye...

There is some css to make it look cooler but it's not required but if you wan't to use the css code you need to add a folder in the project named "Prompt"
and In the folder extract the 'prompt' .ttf files into the folder

Prompt font: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prompt
