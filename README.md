# base-system_jsArrayFunc
It's a system for that is very weird using the object-arrays in javascript, the main file is the 'index.js' file, the html file is for testing 'index.html', so yeah u can dowmload it I think, LOL

There is some css to make it look cooler but it's not required but if you wan't to use the css code you need to add a folder in the project named "Prompt"
and In the folder extract the 'prompt' .ttf files into the folder

Prompt font: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prompt
